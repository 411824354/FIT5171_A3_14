For Launch Class.
//User interface will allow users to do a search based on any of all combinations of 
   attributes in the Launch class(those attributes work as a filter).
//User input are not allowed in these attributes: LaunchDate, launchVehicle, launchServiceProvider, Orbit, Outcome.
//Assume the default value for price is 0, we ask user to select the price range from drop down box, 
  and user can also input price.

//For other attribute, we can use the combination of auto complete search and drop down.

//For LaunchServiceProvider class, the rockets and launches attribute can be empty, so we don't need to test empty of them.
